# cAntiDump

This script protects your Lua scripts from being dumped and leaked! However, this script does not protect your HTML and JS code!

If you need any help or you want to report a bug please join my [discord](https://dsc.gg/catodev)

## Set-Up:
1. extract the downloaded file in your resource folder.
2. rename my script to the script you want to protect.
3. setup the code:
    - Copy your script code to be protected into my client server and config file.
    - Note that you cannot add files other than HTML or JS.
4. (optional) add your UI files:
    - Drag and drop your UI files into the HTML folder.
    - Uncommend line 22 - 30 in the fxmanifest file.
    - To avoid error prints, comment out unused file types.
5. Delete the old script.
6. Restart the server with the new script in autostart.
